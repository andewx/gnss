## GNSS-C++

**Overview**

For our GNSS application is useful however in general we are limited in our approach as we have to deal with certain realtime requirements as the timing parameters for both a transmit and recieve architecture should execute on a reliable basis with the option to utilize threading if needed.

GNSS-SDR was considered for usage but the PlutoSDR AD9363 was not supported
