## GNSS GPS C/A Code SDR Application

#### Requirements

> Running this application on your host machine requires the following:

- MATLAB 2024b
- Communications Toolbox (Pluto and RTL - SDR Hardware Support)


> **Status** - Currently the project is able to setup and test a raw receiver over hardware (PlutoSDR/RTL-SDR) utilizing the `GPSSignalProcessor` class for `Acquire2D` and the `Track`/`TestTrack` functions. Other classes which were implemented ahead of time are scaffolding for decoding LNAV Data. See `main` folder `main.m` matlab file for a working example which hand generates the "GPS" signal and sends over hardware.

Currently project is demonstration purposes only and is therefore not optimized for realtime GNSS Signal Decoding.


#### MATLAB Executable Scripts

1. `main.m` Test GPS signal transmission and reception on Hardware through a loop back device.
2. `maintxpluto.m` Utilizes Pluto SDR as a Transmitter for a continuous alternating binary sequence every 20ms on 920.1MHZ
3. `mainrxrtl.m` Acquires and Tracks Single Frame on RTL-SDR Hardware


### Developer Notes

#### SDR GNSS Signal Computation Requirements

Developing a GNSS GPS Receiver requires the system to maintain lock onto a continuous signal with fairly tight tolerances at 1.023MhZ while we are confined to implementing this project with Software Defined Radio Application. 

On the receiver side of things we break the recieve chain into a the `GPSSignalProcessor` which accomplished the signal locking and acquisition tasks. Followed by the `GPSReceiver` which recieves and decodes the GPS LNAV frame data.

In order to successfully process the data we need to ensure that our processor and receive block ends are completing their processing before the next frame issuance. So if we decide we will signal process 3 bits worth of data in GPS C/A Code data we must process 60ms worth of 1.023MhZ frame data in < 60ms. This means we process 61k samples, so around 240kb worth of frame IQ data.

This may be feasible for a single frame or satellite but to allow multiple satellite reception we will likely at least for a software implementation require parallel signal processing and parallel frame processing capabilities.

Additionally it may be helpful to separate the frame decoding application from the signal processing application in order to ensure our `GPSSignalProcessor` runs at a steady rate without frame, calculation, and data issuance interrupts.

### MATLAB Thread Based Parallel Pools

Thread-based parallelism requires MATLAB R2020b or newer and a supported function set.

Check with:

```
parpool("threads");
```

This will initialize a pool using lightweight threads, not separate MATLAB workers (processes). Itâ€™s efficient for memory-bound tasks or when functions support thread-based execution.


### Testing Methods

We use the `MATLAB` `Sattelite Communications Toolbox` to generate a plausible 30-bit waveform and save this
to a file. This file is used for testing the various GPS Signal Processing components in MATLAB
